Getting started
===============

Download
--------

Use the button on the left to download the latest version. The download is the
same for all platforms.

Install
-------

LibBi runs on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. Installation instructions are in the
[INSTALL.md](https://github.com/lawmurray/LibBi/blob/master/INSTALL.md) file of
the distribution.

Run
---

The [introductory paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3277) is a good place to
start, followed by the [manual](/docs/LibBi-Manual.pdf). The examples in the
introductory paper are available [here](/packages/Windkessel.html) and
[here](/packages/Lorenz96.html), along with [others](/examples.html), for you
to download and run.

Share
-----

LibBi provides a packaging system for bundling model specifications and input
files. If you have a package to share please contact <a
href="http://www.indii.org/research">Lawrence Murray</a>. It can be readily
added to the <a href="/examples.html">Examples</a> page via GitHub.

Develop
-------

Contributions to LibBi can take many forms:

* Expanding language support, e.g. with new probability distributions.
* Adding new inference methods.
* Adding new hardware support.
* Better integrating LibBi with software such as R, MATLAB, GNU Octave and
  Julia.

If you are interested in getting involved in the development of LibBi, please
contact <a href="mailto:lawrence.murray@it.uu.se">Lawrence Murray</a>. The
[manual](/docs/LibBi-Manual.pdf) also contains a developer guide to help
you get started.
