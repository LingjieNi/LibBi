author: Sebastian Funk
---

LibBi version 1.4.0 is [now available](https://github.com/lawmurray/LibBi/archive/1.4.0.tar.gz). This release adds a range of new probability distributions: Poisson, binomial, negative binomial, beta-binomial, exponential, and an improved truncated Gaussian sampler.

Changes
-------

New features:

* New distributions: Poisson, binomial, negative binomial, beta-binomial, exponential.
* Added `--cuda-arch` option for specifying the CUDA architecture.
* Added `--enable-cudafastmath` option for using fast CUDA maths.

Changes:
* State and noise variables now can have inputs.

Performance:
* Improved truncated Gaussian sampler.
* Models are now only simulated if the parameter prior probability density is >0
* Parsing and translating models is now faster.

Fixes:
* No more error is thrown if all particle weights are 0
* `optimise` now works again
* No more warning is thrown if the model name does not match the file name
