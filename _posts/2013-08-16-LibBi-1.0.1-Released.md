LibBi version 1.0.1 is [now available](https://github.com/lawmurray/LibBi/archive/1.0.1.tar.gz). It contains a number of bug fixes and
some additional material added to the manual.

Changes
-------

* Added additional material to manual, including new section with guidance on
  tuning the proposal distribution and number of particles when using PMMH.
* Fixed sampling of joint distribution (`--target joint` now implies
  `--with-param-to-state`, just as `--target prior` and `--target prediction`
  do).
* Fixed reordering of actions and blocks when the same variable appears on
  the left more than once.
* Fixed bug in GPU implementation of multinomial resampler.
* Added `--dry-parse` option to remove parsing overhead when binaries have
  already been compiled.
