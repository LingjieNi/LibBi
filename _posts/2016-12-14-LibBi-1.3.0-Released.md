title: LibBi 1.3.0 released, new anytime features
---

LibBi version 1.3.0 is [now available](https://github.com/lawmurray/LibBi/archive/1.3.0.tar.gz). This release adds a new method: SMC$^2$ with anytime moves. This gives greater control over total execution time than previous methods, and is particularly useful for running LibBi on large cluster systems. See the following paper for the associated research developments:

L. M. Murray, S. Singh, P. E. Jacob and A. Lee. *Anytime Monte Carlo*. 2016. [\[arXiv\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03319).

A package to reproduce the results of this paper is also now [available](http://libbi.org/packages/Anytime.html).
