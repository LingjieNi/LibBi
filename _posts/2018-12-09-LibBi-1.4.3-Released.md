title: LibBi 1.4.3 released
author: Sebastian Funk

LibBi version 1.4.3 is [now available](https://github.com/lawmurray/LibBi/archive/1.4.3.tar.gz).

Changes
-------

New features:

* Metropolis-Hastings sampling with Gaussian proposals now work if the standard deviation is zero; this makes it possible to repeatedly propose the same theta, for example to adjust the number of particles, without the need to change the model and recompile.
* `build-dir`, `version` and `with-lldb` command line options.
* Parameter or initial condition assignments are now overwritten by a given init file.

Fixes:

* The input-interval has been changed to run from [t, t+1) so that timings are preserved if output from a previous run is used as input.
* Fixed compile error in Metropolis resampler.
* Fixed some CUDA problems.
