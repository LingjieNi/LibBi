title: NPZD package for marine biogeochemical modelling now available
author: Lawrence Murray
---

A new [NPZD](/packages/NPZD.html) package is now linked from the website.

This package contains the implementation of a
nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus (NPZD) marine biogeochemical
model, as described in Parslow et al. (2013). It also contains a data set from
the site of Ocean Station Papa (OSP) from Matear (1995), for which the model
is appropriate.
