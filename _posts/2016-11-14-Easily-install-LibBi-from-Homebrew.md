LibBi can now be easily installed from Homebrew on any Mac OS X system, or from Linuxbrew, using:

    brew tap homebrew/science
    brew install libbi

Thanks to [Sebastian Funk](http://sbfnk.github.io/) for preparing this. More info on the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/libbi-users/qDTLdyhkNZE).
